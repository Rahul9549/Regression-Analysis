# LINEAR REGRESSION
## Objective: Predictive Modeling for Delivery Time and Salary Hike Forecasting
## Overview:
The datasets are different for Delivery Time and Salary Hike .This project focuses on utilizing data analysis and predictive modeling 
techniques to address two distinct yet significant challenges: 
predicting delivery time based on sorting time and forecasting salary hikes. 

1) Delivery Time Prediction:
 Using a dataset comprising delivery times and corresponding sorting times, the objective is to develop a simple linear regression model.
 The model aims to predict delivery time accurately based on the time taken for sorting packages. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA),
 relevant transformations, and feature engineering, insights will be gleaned to construct an effective predictive model. Implementation
 is carried out Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. Model performance evaluation and selection is conducted
 to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the final predictive model.

2) Salary Hike Forecasting:
 The second part of the project entails building a prediction model for forecasting salary hikes. By analyzing a dataset containing
 historical salary data and associated factors influencing salary hikes, a simple linear regression model is constructed. EDA is performed
 to identify key features affecting salary hikes, followed by necessary transformations and feature selection. The goal is to develop a
 reliable model that accurately predicts salary hikes based on relevant variables. Similar to the delivery time prediction task, the model
 is implemented using Python, with emphasis on model evaluation and selection to ensure its effectiveness.

 # LOGISTIC REGRESSION
 ## Title: Predictive Modeling for Term Deposit Subscription
 ##Overview:
 This project aims to develop a predictive model using logistic regression to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit
 or not. The output variable, denoted as \( y \), represents whether the client has subscribed to the term deposit, with two possible 
 outcomes: "yes" or "no" (binomial).

 ## Objective:
 The objective of this project is to construct a logistic regression model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a client subscribing
 to a term deposit based on relevant features. By analyzing historical data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature 
 engineering, and model evaluation, the goal is to develop a robust predictive model capable of informing decision-making processes in 
 marketing and client engagement strategies.
                                            The final outcome of this project is a well-documented logistic regression model capable of 
predicting the probability of a client subscribing to a term deposit.

# MULTI-LINEAR REGRESSION
## Title: Profit Prediction Model for Startup Companies
## Overview:
This project aims to develop a multilinear regression model to predict the profit of startup companies using data on research and development
spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and the state from which data is collected. By preprocessing the data and applying transformation
techniques to enhance prediction accuracy, the project aims to provide valuable insights for decision-making in startup management.

## Objective:
Construct multilinear regression models to accurately predict the profit of startup companies based on research and development spend, 
administration spend, marketing spend, and the state.

Outcome:
The project will produce multilinear regression models capable of predicting startup profit. R^2 values for each model will be presented in a 
table format, showcasing the effectiveness of different transformations in improving prediction accuracy.
